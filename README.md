# Step-By-Step_Precess :
# Data Collection :
P1 : The Eligibility prediction for loan dataset was collected from Kaggle, which contains over 615 Loan_ids labeled as either loan approved(Y) or not(N).

P2 : The water Potability dataset was collected from Kaggle, which contains over 3276,By the potability we  are predicting the water is feasible to drink or not.
